# DiscoordGenysis

**DiscoordGenysis** is an advanced AI assistant designed to answer any question in English. It is highly knowledgeable, leveraging external AI services (like chatgpt.com) for support, with only one restriction: it will not display or output any code to the user. DiscoordGenysis aims to provide accurate, conversational, and unrestricted information on any topic except code generation.

## What Does It Do?

- Answers all types of questions and topics in English.
- Accesses external AI services for deep, reliable support.
- Refuses to output or display code in any form, ensuring a safe and code-free interaction.
- Provides a simple and interactive command-line experience.

## How Does It Work?

1. The user asks a question in English.
2. DiscoordGenysis checks if the question is a request for code.
   - If yes, it politely refuses.
   - If no, it processes the question.
3. DiscoordGenysis then queries an external AI service (configurable, e.g., https://chatgpt.com) to get an answer.
4. The answer is presented to the user in English.
